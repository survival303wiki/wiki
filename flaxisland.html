	<p>Water:Small pond</p>
	<p>Rocks and ores:Small stones and Coal</p>
	<p>Animals:None</p>

	<h2>Survival tips</h2>
	<p>You should probably set up a food source, Usually I'll fish for my food but you can also plant things</p>
	<p>There is a water source but do not drink directly from it, Just use a bucket</p>
	<p>It is often visited by others so if you decide to settle there make sure you can protect yourself</p>
